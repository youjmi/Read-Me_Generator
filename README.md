# ReadMeGenerator

Welcome and I present to you my ReadMe Generator!

This Homework Assignment is to be able to create a README file by using Command Line Application. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```
node index.js
```
Once that is invoked, your terminal will proceed with a variety of different questions that will help create your README. If you choose to skip and not add any input you, are allowed to do so by pressing ENTER, however I do want to make note that I have no allowed that for 3 of my questions. 

For these 3 questions I have incorporated a VALIDATE function with an If/Else statemnt inside it so that if an input isnt added, then to send a message via CONSOLE.LOG. 

```validate: (Function)
```

My reason for incorporating this function is because I found the first 3 questions to be necessary and required for any README.

After the user passes through these 3 Required Quesitons, the user can freely skip through the following question by pressing ENTER or type in the necessary details in their appropriate Terminal.

When the user gets to the last question, she/he/they will receive a message stating that their README is now generated.

Lastly, the user will notice their newly generated README appear  and the added information has been transferred!
